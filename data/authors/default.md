My number one focus is providing maximum value to every team I'm a part of. Whether it's delivering the latest feature on time, generating more revenue, saving money on testing time, or making work more fun, my focus is always on finding ways to have a positive impact on the team.

I play hard and am out-worked by few. Having a diverse, multi-discipline background (construction management, heavy equipment operation, business management, financial services, sales, military service, quality assurance) gives me the empathetic perspective required to provide truly valuable software solutions.

It's never about the tech. It's ALWAYS about the problem you're trying to solve and how clearly you communicate and deliver the solution.
