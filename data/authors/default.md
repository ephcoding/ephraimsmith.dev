Hey, guys! Thanks for checking out ephraimsmith.dev! The place where I share my building exploits and stash some notes for future me.

Having the fortune of previoulsy working within multiple industries, I'm able to use my unique and objective perspective to deliver truly creative software solutions.

I play hard and am outworked by few. Though the majority of my freetime is spent adulting with my wife and two kids, I picked up a new hobby in SCUBA and am always looking for new dive spots...
